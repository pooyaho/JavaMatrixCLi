<b>Hi</b>
<br/>
This Java project has developed by Pooya husseini to design a command line interface to create, save,
load and manipulate Matrices and values.
It has purely written in Java. I've used maven, spring and freemarker to decrease the production time.
First of all Run Program.java class,for example write Matrix a 3 3, and see that it will create a 3x3 matrix named 'a'.
You can separate commands in a line with ';'. Commands are not case-sensitive.

There is the full command list:

<#list items as item>
### ${item.getTitle()}
    ${item.getDetail()}

</#list>
### usage #command_name [ #command_name... ]
    Prints how to use the command_name

### help #command_name [ #command_name... ]
    Prints about the command_name
<br/>
Best regards
